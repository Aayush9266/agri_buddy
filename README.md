Farmers often struggle with market access, resulting in low income due to their dependence 
on middlemen. To address this issue, we propose a Mobile App for Direct Market Access for 
Farmers. This platform enables farmers to directly connect with consumers and retailers, 
removing intermediaries and ensuring fairer prices for their produce. The app will offer 
features like product listing, price negotiations, and transaction management, all within a 
user-friendly interface tailored to farmers' needs.

## Features
- [x] Product Listings: Farmers can easily upload their produce, with details like quantity, price, and quality.
- [x] Negotiation Tools: Built-in features allow direct communication between farmers and buyers for real-time price negotiations.
- [x] One-on-One Conversations: Farmers and buyers can engage in direct, private chat sessions to discuss product details, negotiate deals, and build a strong rapport.
- [x] Ratings and Reviews: Buyers can leave feedback, helping farmers build trust and establish reputations based on the quality of their produce.
- [x] Customer Service: A dedicated customer service feature is integrated to assist both farmers and buyers with any issues or queries, ensuring smooth operations.
