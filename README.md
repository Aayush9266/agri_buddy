# AgriBuddy

Farmers often struggle with market access, resulting in low income due to their dependence 
on middlemen. To address this issue, we propose a Mobile App for Direct Market Access for 
Farmers. This platform enables farmers to directly connect with consumers and retailers, 
removing intermediaries and ensuring fairer prices for their produce. The app will offer 
features like product listing, price negotiations, and transaction management, all within a 
user-friendly interface tailored to farmers' needs.
